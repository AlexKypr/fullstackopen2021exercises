browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
server-->browser: {"message":"note created"}

note over browser:
Browser executes the event handler
that renders notes to display through
the redrawNotes() function.
This actually happens before the HTTP POST
when the Save button is pressed.
